Produced by Columbia Pictures and Di Bonaventura Pictures in association with Marvel Entertainment and TSG Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the fourth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). The film was directed by S. J. Clarkson from a screenplay she co-wrote with Claire Parker and the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. It stars Dakota Johnson in the title role, alongside Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, and Adam Scott. In the film, Cassie Webb (Johnson) confronts her past while trying to save three young women and their futures from Ezekiel Sims (Rahim).\nSony began development on a Madame Web film for its shared universe by September 2019, with Sazama and Sharpless hired to write the script. Clarkson joined as director in May 2020, making the film her feature film directorial debut, while Johnson was cast in early 2022. This was followed by additional castings in the following months, particularly for the three Spider-Women characters. Madame Web is a suspense thriller that depicts the titular character's origin story in a standalone universe with an approach that was more grounded and gritty compared to many previously released superhero films. Filming began in mid-July 2022 and wrapped before the end of the year, occurring throughout Massachusetts, including Boston, and in New York City. Clarkson and Parker's involvement as writers was revealed in November 2023.\nMadame Web premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles on February 12, 2024, and was released in the United States on February 14. The film was panned by critics and has grossed $53 million worldwide. The film is currently projected to be a box-office bomb.[9]", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1884, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cff39e2-d7e9-4618-91a5-3df5d4df6b0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cff39e2-d7e9-4618-91a5-3df5d4df6b0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/rules.txt", "file_name": "rules.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1989, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b668a71-a9ed-46af-a41d-acd7ba6b54ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/rules.txt", "file_name": "rules.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1989, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "hash": "66ad58e828dcab53ae748cb23f918ad85149ae6a9855af6ffe84922d26b47faa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d297e8a3-ec87-4f1d-a13a-c94e59136cc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/madam_web.txt", "file_name": "madam_web.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1884, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "hash": "1a28a33d69d1ff3227959bf13390eee10c83a31db885e8453bb3ef103edd5f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb8bd74d-9c4a-45c2-9005-63a68083060a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b2d4cbca5ecfc6aa83ff4f570ef24b1e9ca7526e10c987149286e5cd8bf481b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game. The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone.[54] The scoring team then attempts a try, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT) or conversion, which is a single scoring opportunity. This is generally attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is scored by what would normally be a touchdown, it is worth two points; this is known as a two-point conversion. In general, the extra point is almost always successful, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.[66]\nA field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.[67][68][69] In practice, almost all field goal attempts are done via place kick. While drop kicks were common in the early days of the sport, the shape of modern footballs makes it difficult to reliably drop kick the ball. The last successful scoring play by drop kick in the NFL was accomplished in 2006; prior to that, the last successful drop kick had been made in 1941.[70] After a PAT attempt or successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.[71]\nA safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.[54] In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1989, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb8bd74d-9c4a-45c2-9005-63a68083060a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb8bd74d-9c4a-45c2-9005-63a68083060a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/victor.txt", "file_name": "victor.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1267, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a598341-c950-438b-a839-98db4e4460e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/victor.txt", "file_name": "victor.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1267, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "hash": "e8f580f87ba9ca2cd0fbcde8566f29ec391dfea235c8b5a5c97eb81f59a78dfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cff39e2-d7e9-4618-91a5-3df5d4df6b0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "docs/rules.txt", "file_name": "rules.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1989, "creation_date": "2024-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-22", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-22"}, "hash": "66ad58e828dcab53ae748cb23f918ad85149ae6a9855af6ffe84922d26b47faa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04ef8fc9-f1b2-441c-bbd0-0fd3d4fca0ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8646dbb5d6d451ceeb2e3afef0c54847b9e552d0626381f5d2153a7b4d267ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Victor Wembanyama (/\u02ccw\u025bmb\u0251\u02d0n\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0m\u0251\u02d0/ WEM-bahn-YAH-mah; French: [vikt\u0254\u0281 w\u025bmbanjama]; born 4 January 2004), nicknamed \"Wemby\",[2] is a French professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The album features uncredited guest vocals from West's daughter North, Freddie Gibbs, YG, Quavo, Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, Bump J, Lil Durk, Rich the Kid, and Chris Brown. Production was primarily handled by West himself, alongside Digital Nas, JPEGMafia, Chrishan, 88-Keys, Wheezy, Ojivolta, DJ Camper, Timbaland, No I.D., Wax Motif, the Legendary Traxster, and Anthony Kilhoffer, among others. The album follows both artists' 2021 studio albums Donda and Cheers to the Best Memories, and marks the third collaborative album for each of them.\nVultures 1 sustained multiple delays and changes to its tracklist before its final release; it was first teased throughout late 2023 under the placeholder title \u00a5$. Several listening events to promote the album, including a multi-stadium listening event and a concert in Reggio Emilia, were canceled. \"Vultures\", which features guest vocals from Bump J and Lil Durk, was released on November 22 and served as its lead single. West previewed snippets of songs for Vultures 1 at a minor event in a restaurant in Wynwood, Florida, on December 10, and held the first in a set of listening events titled \"Vultures Rave\" two days later, which featured artists of whom were intended to appear on the album. Listening parties in Chicago and New York City on February 8 and 9, 2024, respectively, bookended the release of the second single, \"Talking / Once Again\", which features uncredited guest vocals from North West. The album was released on February 10, commemorating the twentieth anniversary of West's debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004). It is set to be followed up by Vultures 2 and Vultures 3, slated for release on March 8 and April 5, respectively.
